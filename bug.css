The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-div {
  color: red;
}

#special-id {
  color: green;
}

#special-id.special-div {
  color: purple; /* This rule is unexpected, causing the error */
}

#special-id div {
  color: yellow; /* This rule is unexpected, causing the error */
}
```

This code attempts to style an element with the ID `special-id` that also has the class `special-div`.  The issue is that the rule `#special-id.special-div` is highly specific because it combines an ID selector and a class selector. This causes a surprising outcome where `color: purple` overrides the more general selectors. 

In complex CSS, these unexpected combinations of selectors can lead to surprising cascading behaviors and result in subtle bugs that are hard to track down.  The problem isn't a syntax error but rather a logic error related to the unexpected specificity of the CSS selectors. Similarly, `#special-id div` will unexpectedly match any child `div` element within `#special-id`. 

The error is not a syntax error but rather an unexpected specificity conflict.
